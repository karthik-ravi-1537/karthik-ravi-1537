# Projects

A mix of research, personal projects, work projects, and open source contributions.
Most production and research work is under NDA or in private repos - what's listed here is what I can publicly share.

## Research

**DistilKit** - Universal, config-driven knowledge distillation framework for systematic study of teacher-student dynamics. 161 configs, SLURM/W&B integration, multi-task support (classification, generation, translation), LoRA fine-tuning. Discovered the "overconfident-wrong teacher" paradox: frozen fine-tuned teachers can catastrophically harm students. Proved simplicity wins - more distillation signals actually hurt performance.

**AI Interpretability Lab** - Exploring how transformers work under the hood using TransformerLens, nnsight, and SAELens.

**XRAG-MGR** - Explainable RAG with hierarchical provenance tracking (207 passing tests).

## Personal / Hobby

**Machine-Learning-Basics** - Comprehensive hands-on ML learning resource (NumPy → Pandas → Scikit-Learn) with automated environment setup, verification scripts, and JupyterHub support. Expanding to include NLP and Deep Learning.

**RAG Demo** - Progressive RAG techniques from vanilla to graph-based retrieval, covering multiple chunking strategies (semantic, hierarchical, recursive), knowledge graph construction, and a comprehensive evaluation framework.

**MCP Demo** - Calculator and filesystem MCP servers, interactive web interface, CLI tooling.

**Microservices Demo** - Full microservices architecture with Python FastAPI, React TypeScript, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis.

**NLP University ChatBot** - RAG-based Q&A system for Northeastern with multi-turn conversation, persona-based filtering, and ChromaDB vector persistence.

## Older / Learning Projects

**Deep Research Agent** - A hobby project to understand agentic loops. Multi-hop reasoning, tool-calling, multi-model orchestration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.), multiple search API integrations.

**LangChain Platform Demo** - LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith orchestration, monitoring, and analytics.

**Reinforcement Learning Lab** - Policy gradients (REINFORCE, actor-critic), Deep RL (DQN, PPO, SAC) across Gymnasium environments with custom wrappers.

## Work Projects

**Gamification @ Sri Mandir (AppsForBharat)** - Designed habit loops grounded in cultural patterns (karma meters, streaks, devotional milestones). Integrated gamification into spiritual practice - respecting attention, not hijacking it. Instrumented full funnel: Activation → Retention → Referral → Revenue → Acquisition. Resulted in 5x DAU growth and industry-best D30 retention (~15%).

**Loan & Legal Infra @ CreditNirvana (via ProdSmiths)** - Built end-to-end loan lifecycle and legal case management systems for India's top ARCs. Recovery tracking, court case pipelines, escalation handling. Enabled operational clarity, compliance integrity, and automation across legal-financial workflows.

**PolicyManager @ Qualcomm** - Contributed to a system-level module that governs access policies on Snapdragon SoCs. Shipped across hundreds of millions of Android devices. Practiced TDD, integration cycles, and large-scale system validation. QualStar Award for critical resolution on customer hardware rollout.

**GenAI MVPs @ Hivel** - Built internal MVPs using OpenAI, LangChain, and embeddings to surface engineering insights. GenAI auto-analyzed productivity data to drive retros. Value-first LLM integration - clarity over hype.

**Grassroots Maker Spaces @ Yuva Chintana Foundation** - Led field research in rural Karnataka, pitched educational equity initiatives to govt/CSR. Learned to build with humility and context - from users, not assumptions.
