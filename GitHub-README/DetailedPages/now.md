# What I'm Currently Doing

A quick look at what's occupying my time and mind in 2025–26.

## Research

- **DistilKit** - A config-driven knowledge distillation framework designed to make the research engine go faster. The goal: run more experiments, log everything properly, reproduce results reliably, and maintain momentum and consistency across research cycles. 161 configs, compute integrations (Google Colab, HPC/SLURM), W&B logging, multi-task support (classification, generation, translation), LoRA fine-tuning. Good engineering enabled good and fast research.
- **XRAG-MGR** - Explainable RAG with hierarchical provenance tracking.

## Building

- **Machine-Learning-Basics** - My give-back to the community. Started this repo solo to help students get comfortable with ML basics in a layered fashion (NumPy → Pandas → Scikit-Learn), with automated setup, verification scripts, and JupyterHub support. Used for weekly ML sessions at Northeastern University as part of the class and other clubs. Now has fellow contributors onboard, and we're expanding to include advanced ML, NLP, and Deep Learning topics.
- Contributing to open source: **cognee** (AI knowledge graphs).

## Teaching

- **ML Teaching Assistant** (CS 6140) at Northeastern under Dr. Smruthi Mukund.

## Looking For

- Full-time roles (2026) in **AI infrastructure, ML engineering, or research engineering**
- Teams building retrieval systems, agentic AI, or AI infrastructure at scale
