## About Me

I build production ML systems - RAG pipelines, LLM evaluation frameworks, agentic AI, and multimodal ML.

My arc: **Engineering (Qualcomm) → Product (startups) → Engineering + ML/AI (deliberate return)**. Each phase built a different muscle - systems discipline, user empathy, shipping under constraints. They compound.

Currently pursuing my **MS in Computer Science @ Northeastern (4.0 GPA)**, focused on retrieval systems, agentic AI, LLM evaluation, and AI interpretability.

## What I'm Currently Doing

(Full context → [now.md](./GitHub-README/DetailedPages/now.md))

- **ML Teaching Assistant** (CS 6140) at Northeastern under Dr. Smruthi Mukund
- Building **DistilKit** - a universal, config-driven knowledge distillation framework
- Maintaining **Machine-Learning-Basics** - a hands-on ML learning resource for students
- Open to full-time roles (2026) in AI infrastructure and ML engineering

## Career Highlights

(Full journey → [career-highlights.md](./GitHub-README/DetailedPages/career-highlights.md))

- **SigIQ** (ML Resident, Berkeley): Production RAG pipeline on AWS, LLM-as-a-Judge evals, eval-driven agentic loops
- **Interpersonal** (SWE Co-Op, San Francisco): Desktop app, Core ML framework, multimodal pipelines (ASR, emotion recognition, LLM fusion)
- **ProdSmiths** (Engineering Manager): Architected core platforms → built team → team acqui-hired
- **AppsForBharat** (Product): Led Sri Mandir to 5x DAU (1M+ DAU), Seed → Series B
- **Qualcomm** (Engineer): PolicyManager on Snapdragon SoCs, QualStar Award
