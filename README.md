## 👋 About Me

I’m an engineer-at-heart who enjoys building useful things, building them well, and scaling them meaningfully.  
My work spans **consumer products**, **infrastructure products**, **GenAI**, and **0→1 product journeys**.  
I care about clarity, utility, performance, taste, and empathy in both code and collaboration.

Currently pursuing my **MS in Computer Science @ Northeastern**, wherein I’m revisiting (and reinvesting in)
fundamentals for the next phase of my career in this AI-native world.

## 🚧 What I’m Currently Doing

(Full context → [now.md](./GitHub-README/DetailedPages/now.md))

- Studying Distributed Systems, NLP, ML/AI, Deep-Learning, and AI Application Architectures (Agentic Flows, RAG, etc.).
- Prototyping RAG systems with LangChain + OpenAI/Gemini/Claude.
- Seeking Winter/Spring 2026 internships and Full-time roles (2026)
- Interested in AI Interpretability.
    - Owing to my interest in understanding how AI functions 'under-the-hood' and in building responsible AI systems.
